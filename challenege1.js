 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * Follow the steps below and answer the discusssion questions that follow.
 * 
 * 1. Read over the code that follows. In what order will the outputs "Step 1",
 *    "Step 2", and "Step 3" be printed? How do you know?
 *  step 1
 *  step 3    because step 2 has a delay of 2 seconds
 *  step 2
 * 
 * 2. Run this code using `node challenge1.js`. In what order were the steps
 *    printed?
 *
 *   The same order i said 
 * 
 * 3. Change the delay time in the `snooze` function from 2000 ms to 0. In what
 *    order will the steps be printed now? Why? Re-run the code again to verify
 *    your expectation. Were you correct?
 * 
 * I expected the order to be 1 2 3 . but the order stayed the same because step 1 and 3 are 0(1)
 *
